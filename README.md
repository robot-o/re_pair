Global Game Jam 2020 Entry

Couple's counceling simulator based on OCEAN (big5) personality model.

## Gameplay

A couple visits your office. They are a set of traits and needs.

1. During the first session you get to know them a little.  
    An attribute and a priority of each partner is revealed.

2. You suggest something that they should focus on in their relationship and reschedule.  
    Time passes, they might go on a date, maybe there's an argument.

3. They return, you get to know them better, they tell you how it went.  
    Known values and priorities may have changed, new information is revealed.

4. Repeat step 1-3 a bunch.  
For as long as they can afford to pay you

5. Make final decision on whether or not they should break up or stay together.

6. After some time, the couple leaves a Yelp review.

7. If your Yelp review score drops below a certain mark, you will lose customers  
    And make less money -> forced to lower your hourly rates to re-gain customers  
    Repair your reputation!?

### Couples Attributes

Based on the OCEAN personality model, each individual is scored on their Big5.
In addition to their own score, they have expecations/requirements that their partners should match.
The trick is not to change the personality of a partner (which can be a side-effect) but to change their expecations.
